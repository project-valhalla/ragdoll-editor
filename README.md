This repository is a fork of Lee "eihrul" Salzman's ragdoll editor. It is designed to generate ragdoll scripts for IQM and MD5 skeletal model formats supported by the Cube engines.

Given the abstruse nature of the editor, the primary objective of this fork is to reorganize the files, fine-tune the code and provide comprehensive documentation for using the editor, demystifying its complexity as it's not as daunting as it may initially appear.
